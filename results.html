                                      system, they will also help in maintaining and updating the programme to ensure that all security problems are fixed, and it 
                                      operates with new databases. In a role of a software developer they create the applications that allow people to do specific
                                        tasks on a computer or mobile and others develop the underlying systems that control networks.
