                <h3>Learn more about this role</h3>
                <p>The role of a software developer engages in identifying, designing, installing and testing a software system 
                    they have built for a company from the ground up. It can range from creating internal programmes that can help 
                    businesses be more efficient to producing systems that can be sold on the open market. Once software developers 
                    have delivered the final software system, they will also help in maintaining and updating the programme to ensure 
                    that all security problems are fixed, and it operates with new databases. In a role of a software developer they 
                    create the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on a computer or mobile and others develop the underlying 
                    systems that control networks.

                    After mapping out the design, creating flowcharts and drafting out each step of the process, developers 
                    will build diagrams and models to instruct programmers how to write the code for the program.
